The CSS property `calc()` can produce unexpected results if you are not careful with operator precedence and unit handling. For example, `width: calc(100% - 10px);` works as expected, but `width: calc(100% - 10);` will likely result in an error because the `10` lacks a unit.  Another issue is with nested `calc()` functions, which need careful attention to parentheses to ensure correct order of operations.  Incorrect nesting could lead to unexpected widths, heights, or other layout problems.  Also, ensure your `calc()` values are compatible, mixing percentages and pixels needs careful consideration for responsiveness.
